I have been contacted by one of the biggest gym chains in North America to discover the best location for the opening of a new cutting-edge gym in the city of Toronto. The facility needs to be open in an under-served area, where people are not satisfied by the current offer. In order to avoid facing fierce competition with other gyms, the location should be identified as a neighborhood with the lowest number of gyms in the area and the lowest rating from FourSquare users. In this way, we will match an un-met demand where competion is low. The goal of the client is indeed to absorb unhappy clients of already existing gym facilities. In this way, we do not need to create a demand, but to capture it.
